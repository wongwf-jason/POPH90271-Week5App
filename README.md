# Week 5: Uncertainty and Sensitivity Analysis â€” Shiny App
**POPH90271 Infectious Diseases Modelling** \
Created by: Mr Jason Wong (MD4-MPH Candidate) \
Supervisor: Dr Trish Campbell (The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity) \
Version: 1.0 (July 2024)

## Shiny Application Learning Objectives
Using an example from the extant literature, gain an intuitive feel of:
- [ ] How infectious disease models react to changes in parameter and state inputs (*sensitivity*), and
- [ ] The different approaches with which parameter and state inputs can be sampled (*non-informative uncertainty*).
- [ ] How computational considerations affect feasibility of simulations (*implementation efficiency*)
